<!-- Description -->
## Description

Hey! Welcome to Nitro Notes! This is just an on the go notes taking web application I built from learning React.js.

This web app uses Node.js for backend. The main part of the app is based on React.js, which is a javascript library. As soon as you publish the note by clicking on the `+` button it gets displayed on the homepage. If you have completed the task you can use the `Delete icon` button to delete the note. 
Have fun while using it! :)
